initialise, queue, current thread, idle thread --- run the idle thread first thing in initialize 

everytime we context switch, reset current thread


Do we context switch out of the runnable queue, onto the idle thread
 
Idle thread - does it clean up? and how?

why does freestack not need stack end?
 how to get final proc args

 final proc, return?

 also, life cycle of the thread, does the thread terminate before final proc is called - to be able to call minithread_self() to put the thread on cleanup queue

 what to do with the kernel thread given to us by windows? idle thread?

Should the idle proc call stop or yield?
