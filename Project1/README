PortOS Educational Operating System
===================================
These folders contain the different versions of the PortOS virtualization
layer, and some stub files which you will need to implement in order to make
your OS work.  

If you need to make any changes to the Makefile, or you have questions, please
contact the course staff explaining why before doing so.

We will post project instructions on the course website, so please refer
to it for the most up to date information.
